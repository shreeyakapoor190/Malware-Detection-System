### PSEUDOCODE:

•	Step 1:	Import packages, functions, and classes

•	Step 2:	Get the data to work with and, if appropriate, transform it

•	Step 3:	Create a classification model and train (or fit) it with your existing data

•	Step 4:	 Evaluate your model to see if its performance is satisfactory

-	#### Feature scaling:
 Feature scaling is a method used to normalize the range of independent variables or features of data. In data processing, it is also known as data normalization and is generally performed during the data pre-processing step.

-	#### Confusion matrix:
 A confusion matrix is a technique for summarizing the performance of a classification algorithm. ... Calculating a confusion matrix can give you a better idea of what your classification model is getting right and what types of errors it is making.


-	#### Decision Tree classifier: 
A decision tree is a graphical representation of all possible solutions to a decision based on certain conditions. On each step or node of a decision tree, used for classification, we try to form a condition on the features to separate all the labels or classes contained in the dataset to the fullest purity.

-	#### Logistic Regression: 
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of classes. Logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability value.
